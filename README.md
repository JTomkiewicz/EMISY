# Microprocessor Systems

## Description:

Course presents efficient methods of microprocessor systems design and debugging. Introduction to the subject tells about 3-bus architecture, main blocks (CPU, ROM, RAM, IO) and interrupts. The main part is about mothods of microprocessor systems design illustrated with standard solutions (interfacing of common microprocessor systems components).
